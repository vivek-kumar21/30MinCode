    question: "Which language should I take?",
    answer:
      "The choice of programming language depends on your goals and the type of projects you want to work on. For web development, JavaScript is essential. For data science, Python is highly recommended. For system-level programming, C or C++ is preferred. Each language has its strengths and is suited for different tasks.",

    question: "What is the best language for web development?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript is the most popular language for web development. It is used for both frontend (React, Angular, Vue) and backend (Node.js) development. HTML and CSS are also essential for web development.",
  },
  {
    type: "text",
    question: "What is the best language for data science?",
    answer:
      "Python is the most widely used language for data science due to its simplicity and the vast number of libraries available (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn). R is another popular language for statistical analysis and visualization.",

    question: "Is C++ harder to learn than Python?",
    answer:
      "C++ is generally considered harder to learn than Python due to its complex syntax and manual memory management. Pythonâ€™s syntax is simpler and more readable, making it an easier language for beginners.",

    question: "What is the best language for mobile app development?",
    answer:
      "For Android app development, Java and Kotlin are the primary languages. For iOS development, Swift is the preferred language. Cross-platform development can be done using frameworks like React Native (JavaScript) and Flutter (Dart).",
